    "Your task is to utilize machine learning to either classify AND/OR segment mammograms or neither, as long as you justify why it is useful to do whatever it is you want to do. If someone turns in a deep dream assignment using mammograms this might be amusing, but not so useful to patients. Consider this a mini-project, we highly suggest you work with 1 other person, it can be someone in your team. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the mammograms, the dataset includes segmentations and mass_case_description_train_set.csv, which contains information about the mass shape, mass margins, assessment number, pathology diagnosis, and subtlety. Take some time to research what all of these different fields mean and whether you can use them in your algorithm or not. You dont need to use all of what is provided to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use the ROIâ€™s or segmentations to extract features, and then train a classifier based on those features using the algorithms presented to you in the machine learning lectures, does not need to be deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. use convolutional neural networks, feel free to use any of the code we went over in class or use your own (custom code, sklearn, keras, Tensorflow etc.). If you dont want to place helper functions and classes into this notebook, place them in a .py file in the same folder called helperfunctions.py and import them into this notebook. \n",

The writeup doesnt need to be long, 1 page will do and cite at least one clinical paper and one technical paper. If you like python please place the writeup and code into this notebook. Use the markdown to tell is what you are doing in each section. You will not be graded on the performance of your model, only the scientific soundness of your claims, methodology, evaluation (ie fair but insightful statistics) and discussion of the shortcomings of what you tried. \n",

    "2. Describe the relevant statistics of the data, how were the images taken ? how were they labeled ? what is the class balance and majority classifier accuracy ? How will you divide the data into testing, training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe your data pipeline, ie how is the data scrubbed, normalized, stored and fed to the model for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explain how the model you chose works along side the code for it and at least one technical citation to give credit where credit is due. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. There are many ways to do training, take us through how you do it. (ie we used early stopping and we decided when to stop based on validation loss)  \n",

    "###  Approach and Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Mammograms are difficult to classify because identifying features for malignant tumors can be vague and masses in mammograms can appear anywhere with any orientation in the breast tissue. Though the setup for this problem suggests use of CNNs, we want to use traditional ML techniques in this exploratory research for a variety of reasons. The principal reason that we want to do this is for the feature analysis possible with traditional ML technqiues that isn't possible with CNNs. According to a study from Britton et. all, sensitivity of radiologists in classifying mammograms can vary between 53.1-74.1%. Through feature analysis, indiciative features could be highlighted for radiologists to focus on, potentially raising sensitivites and decreasing the variability of senestivities between radiologists. \n",

    "The images were taken from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), a database which consists of 2620 mammogram studies. These images are X-rays, recorded as grey-scale images. Previous work had been done to filter these images to the ROI mass. Within features_matrix.csv, results of calculations on these masses have been recorded. We have didvided the data into training and testing at random, leaving 10% out for testing. 52% of these images are negatively labeled while 48% are positively labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, semantic features associated with some on the images have also been included. These semantic features include the type of view included in the image, which side of the patient the breast was on, and case descriptions with a limited vocabulary describing characteristics of the mass. We believe that semantic features such as breast density, mass shape, and mass margins can be highly useful. The limited vocabulary of these qualitative features allows one-hot encoding and incorporation into our feature vectors for traditional ML methods. \n",
